# Project Overview
The goal of this project is to create a Federated Learning strategy agnostic framework to be able to run smoothly any parameter-decoupling algorithm by only implementing the new strategy.
## Goals
- Run Centralised Federated Learning rounds with personalised models, specific aggregation/training strategy (e.g FedPer, FedAvg, FedAvg+Ft, ...) 
- Automatised metrics and plots generation
- Use at maximum the configuration files to specify a new strategy/model/technic.
